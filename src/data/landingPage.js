                connectors to real-life (and work) learning contexts, ReflectCE
                helps busy learners ubiquitously capture self-evaluations that
                described their understanding of an idea, assess its clinical
                relevance or professional impact to performance and draw meaning
                into clinical outcomes within their practice. In return,
                reflections result in continuing education credit.`,
